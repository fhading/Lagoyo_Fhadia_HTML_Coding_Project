            <h2>Blog Post 1: iOS 17 review: Notable new features and streamlined touches
                Lots of improvements for iPhone users with iPhone-using friends.</h2>
            <p>Your latest iPhone update is officially here. iOS 17 brings some substantial new features and a lot of upgrades that streamline how you use your iPhone, especially when connecting with other iPhone users.

                While the lock screen customizations introduced in iOS 16 formed the big visual change last year,
                 Apple has now applied a similar makeover to your phone calls and contact lists. And at a 
                 time when there is no shortage of video call apps and services, itâ€™s trying to make 
                 FaceTime even more compelling.</p>

            <h2>Blog Post 2:What is HTML?</h2>
            <p>HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) is a language used behind the scenes of every website.
                 HTML uses tags to form the content in a visible way to display on a web page. 
                 It is relatively easy to learn and does not require lots of time to understand. 
                 It includes everything from your headers, spaces and paragraphs on your web page.

                HTML can be as simple as writing this blog, 
                but it is written in specific tags so the browser can translate the content into a visible form.
                 The browser does not display tags to the end user, but instead uses it to render the web page
                  so the content is seen in an organised order.</p>
