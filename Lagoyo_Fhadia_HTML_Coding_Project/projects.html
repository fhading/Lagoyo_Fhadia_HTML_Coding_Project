        <h3>PhotoShop</h3>
        <p>Adobe Photoshop is a raster graphics editor developed and published by Adobe Inc.
             for Windows and macOS. It was originally created in 1987 by Thomas and John Knoll. 
             Since then, the software has become the most used tool for professional digital art,
              especially in raster graphics editing. The software's name is often colloquially
               used as a verb (e.g. "to photoshop an image", "photoshopping", and 
               "photoshop contest")[6] although Adobe discourages such use.[7].</p>
